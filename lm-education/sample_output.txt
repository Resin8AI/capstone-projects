When selecting a flow meter for water, there are several technical specifications you might want to consider to ensure you choose a device that meets your application needs. Here are some key specifications to keep in mind:

Flow Rate: The range of flow rates the meter can accurately measure, often given in liters per minute (L/min) or gallons per minute (GPM).
Accuracy: The degree to which the flow meter's measurements are close to the true value, typically expressed as a percentage.
Pressure Rating: The maximum pressure the flow meter can withstand during operation, usually specified in pounds per square inch (psi) or bar.
Temperature Range: The range of temperatures in which the flow meter can operate without compromising accuracy or integrity.
Material Compatibility: The materials used in the construction of the flow meter should be compatible with water and any other substances that may be present.
Connection Type: The type of connections used to integrate the flow meter into your system, such as threaded, flanged, or sanitary fittings.
Output Signal: The type of signal output by the flow meter, which could be analog (4-20 mA), digital (pulse or frequency), or a communication protocol (Modbus, HART).
Size and Installation Requirements: The physical dimensions of the flow meter and any installation constraints, such as inline or insertion type, and the direction of flow.
Maintenance and Durability: The expected lifespan of the flow meter and the level of maintenance required to keep it functioning properly.
Certification and Standards Compliance: Any industry-specific certifications or standards the flow meter complies with, such as NSF for potable water applications or ATEX for explosive environments.
Cost: The initial cost of the flow meter and any ongoing operational costs.

Based on your requirements, the following products may suit your use case:

Emerson 1-1/2" RF 316SS Coriolis Meter: Offers high accuracy and a wide range of flow rates, making it a robust choice. It's constructed from stainless steel, ensuring compatibility with water. It might be on the higher end in terms of cost but provides low maintenance and durability.
CAMERON 2" FNPT Liquid Turbine Flow Meter: Suitable for moderate to high flow rates with good accuracy. Its FNPT connection allows for easy integration into your system. The cost may be more economical compared to the Coriolis Meter.
Rosemount Magnetic Wafer Flowtube Sensor: Excellent for a wide range of flow rates and offers superior accuracy. The 6" size may require significant space, and it's important to verify the material compatibility and standards compliance.
ABB 3" 600 Coriolis Flow Meter, Rosemount 8800AW030SA1N1P1M5 3" 150 Vortex Flowmeter, and 4" x 6" Turbine Flow Meter: These options offer a balance between cost and performance. The specifics of their flow rate range, accuracy, pressure rating, and other factors would need to be considered in light of your specific application requirements.
