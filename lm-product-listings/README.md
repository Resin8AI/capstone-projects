# Language Model for Industrial Product Listings

This example demonstrates the base functionality of our project: generating product listings from given product information and scraped internet data. It's a basic illustration, created using a simple ChatGPT call, and represents the minimum of what our LM should achieve.

*Expected input:*
- Product information: [product_information.json](product_information.json)
- Scraped data: [raw_internet_data.json](raw_internet_data.json)

*Expected output:*
- Product listing: [sample_listing.txt](sample_listing.txt)
